# Task Manager Api

## Description
The Task Manager API is a RESTful web service that allows users to manage their tasks. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as retrieving task details and a list of all tasks. In addition, tasks can be added to projects, as well as filtered and sorted.

This API is built using Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. Nest.js provides a solid foundation for developing robust and modular applications, making it an ideal choice for projects like the Task Manager API.
